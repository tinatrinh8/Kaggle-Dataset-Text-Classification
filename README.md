# Text-Classification 🍯🪸🎿🧶🐛
Conduct an empirical study on text classification, utilizing DL methodologies on textual data.

## 🎫 Overview
ML is fundamentally empirical especially for experimentation to derive solutions. Ensuring reproducibility is crucial for validating the effectiveness of any approach. Experimental setup required for text classification problems and the application of deep learning techniques.

## 🍇 Goals
- Utilize Python machine learning libraries, with a focus on scikit-learn.
- Explore Kaggle for dataset resources.
- Implement and experiment with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
- Conduct simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using spaCy.
- Execute a classification empirical study using real-world textual data.

## ⛈️ Chosen Dataset
**Airline Passenger Reviews**: Classify 10,761 passenger reviews into promoters, detractors, and passives. [Reduced Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malharkhatu/airline-passenger-reviews/data)

## 🍱 Technologies
- **Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Colab**: Essential tools for the assignment.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing MLP classifiers and processing textual data.
